# TO-DO-APP-ON-AWS-USING-MERN-WEB-STACK
This repository explains the steps involved in creating a to-do application on AWS using the MERN web stack. The MERN web stack consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS as its working components. 
Full-stack online applications can be deployed more quickly and easily with the MERN Stack, a Javascript stack.
The MERN Stack is made up of the following 4 technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

* Mongo-DB: MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
* ExpressJS: A server-side Web Application framework for Node.js.
* ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.
* Nodejs:
It is intended to simplify and streamline the development process.
Each of these four technologies plays a significant role in the creation of web apps and offers developers an end-to-end environment in which to operate.
